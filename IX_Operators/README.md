# BCOP - IX Operators

This document describes policy and network components that comprise the best current operational practices for running a public Internet Exchange (IX) point. It also provides general configuration parameters and guidelines, but does not include vendor-specific configuration information.

There are a multitude of exchange points around the world each of which has a set of independent providers using a common exchange fabric to connect and pass traffic to one another. Although there are always specific configuration requirements for particular exchange points, there are also common configuration parameters that, if used, will add to the stability of any exchange.

This BCOP lays out the guidelines that should apply in most situations, providing a foundation for Exchange-specific requirements, but not superseding them. IX operators may opt to diverge from this BCOP based on their specific constraints and considerations.

***Status:** This is a Draft BCOP in the process of further development.*
